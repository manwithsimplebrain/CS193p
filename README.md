## Assignment I

- [x] Get the Memorize game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. Type in all the
code. **Do not copy/paste from anywhere**.

- [ ] After doing so, you can feel free to remove the ⊖ and ⊕ buttons at the bottom of the
screen (or not, your choice) and all of the code that supports it.

- [x] Add a title "Memorize!" to the top of the screen. It’s a title, so it should be in a large
font.

- [ ] Add at least 3 "theme choosing" buttons to your UI, each of which causes all of the
cards' emojis to be replaced with new emojis from the chosen theme.

- [ ] The face up or face down state of the cards does not need to change when the user
changes the theme.
